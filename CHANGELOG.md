## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Long (multipart) SMS are forwarded as one message instead of fragments
- No crash when Contacts permission is denied (contacts is optional)
- Blocklist matches alphanumeric sender IDs (e.g. `HDFCBK` blocks `AX-HDFCBK`)
- Loop prevention matches local and international number formats
- Forwarded content is no longer prefixed with "Msg: "
- Forwards and replies use the SIM that received the message

### ✨ Improvements
- Telegram/webhook forwards that fail while offline are retried automatically
- No background service, persistent notification or alarms — the app runs only when an SMS arrives
- Live status header, validated settings, "Send test message"
- Targets Android 16 (API 36); webhooks must use https
